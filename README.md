## üìã Project Overview

Built by Venkat Buthuru, KnowledgeForge is an intelligent AI-powered knowledge management system that transforms your documents into an interactive, searchable knowledge base. This application allows users to upload various document formats (PDFs, Word documents, text files) and then engage in natural language conversations with an AI assistant that understands the content of their documents.

The system combines modern web technologies with advanced AI capabilities to provide a seamless experience for document management, intelligent search, and conversational AI interactions. Users can organize their knowledge, get instant answers from their document collection, and maintain conversation history for future reference.

- Check Node.js version (requires 16+)
- Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again
- Ensure port 3000 is not in use by another application

**Database connection errors:**
- Verify PostgreSQL service is running
- Check username/password in DATABASE_URL
- Ensure the `knowledgeforge` database exists

Document upload fails:
- Check file size (must be under 50MB by default)
- Ensure `uploads/` directory exists in backend folder
- Verify file format is supported (PDF, DOCX, TXT)

Development Commands:

Backend Commands:
```bash
# Run tests
